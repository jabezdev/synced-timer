# synced-timer

**timer screen** is a simple, share-by-link web application for putting big timers or countdowns on screen — and letting others follow along live on their own devices.
No accounts. No installs. Just create a timer, share the link, and everyone sees the same thing in real‑time.

## Proposed Features

### Two modes:
- Timer — set a duration (30s, 5m, 50h, etc.), with start/pause/reset.
- Countdown — target a specific date & time (“5 days, 4 hours, 35 minutes from now”).

- Full screen mode for projection.
- Customizable visuals (themes, backgrounds, font sizes).
- Shareable links for everyone to view.
- Real‑time sync: updates instantly on all devices.
- No login required.
